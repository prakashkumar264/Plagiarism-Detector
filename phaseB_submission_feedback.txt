Score: 85
- including some functionality for highlighting relevant sections of code would be nice
- well done doing a thorough job looking up and explaining the infrastructure for the system
- UML sequence diagram is useful in illustrating the communications/interactions between system components
- but, we expected a UML class diagram that described how the system components interact with each other
- we did not see any Java interfaces for your main system components
