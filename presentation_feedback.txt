Group 2 ---- 85
- UI: similarities reported as comments; adding visual diff view would be helpful
- too much focus on architectural aspects, use of frameworks, etc
- class diagram does not show the breakdown of the system into components (as in your sequence diagram), or how components interact with each other
- reasonable choice of algorithms. it would have been useful to reflect this in your design
- handling of questions was ok, but not a very clear answer to question about what major components the system will consist of
